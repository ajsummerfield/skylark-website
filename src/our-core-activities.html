                <p>Prayer is the engine room for all we are and do.</p>
                <p>Spearheaded by Sue Gibson, our Prayer Pastor, along with an amazing leadership team, we have established a healthy rhythm of prayer that links and supports the ministries and individuals across the network, as well as developing a culture that connects into the wider kingdom picture nationally and globally.</p>
                <p>Prayer Connect Champions – Each church charity or ministry is asked to supply a 'Prayer Champion' who will share and receive prayer needs, be envisioned and equipped to pray and kept in the loop on specific prayer initiatives.</p>

                <p>Twice a year we gather senior leaders of churches, ministries and charities along with their leadership teams for a time of envisioning, connection, input and development.</p>
                <p>Connect is an opportunity to gather socially the night before the converge day, to eat together and enjoy relating with one another and have fun in an informal setting.</p>
                <p>Converge is a more intentional time to gather and grow together, to catch vision and to come onto the same page before we are sent back to our different spheres of influence.</p>
                <p>These times are usually held in Chelmsford, although more recently they have moved online due to covid.</p>

                <p>Every other year, we host a time away for those in senior leadership, whether that is in a church, charity or missional setting. We recognize that leadership can be challenging as well as rewarding and this is a valuable time for leaders to refuel, replenish, recharge and relate with one another.</p>
                <p>Offering a source of strength and support to those in Senior Leadership, our Leadership Advances provide an opportunity to receive great input as well as prayer, rest and relationship.</p>
