            <h5>FOOTER ON ALL PAGES</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Move the copyright 2021 Skylarkinternational further out to the left edge and then down so it sits level and opposite to info@skylarkin</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
                <li>Move the right corner items (charity number, copyright, logo, and the menu who we are etc..) closer to the outside edge</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done, although it does look a little odd to me, but that's fine</li>
                <li>Could we put ‘ Rebuilding Ruins • Building Bridges • Creating Culture’ in the middle of the footer</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Please can we go with Home 2</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - OK</li>
                <li>Anna is going to send you a new video for the background to replace the water. This will be the video you have already seen minus the text</li>

                <li class="dg">DG - OK</li>
                <li>Could we make the circle arrows just a tad smaller and same size on every page</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done, now 30px instead of 40px</li>
                <li>Also the body of text, if we could make the paragraph thinner each side. It may mean we need to make the body text smaller but just so there is more gap between them, as I feel they are a tiny bit too close.</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done. I'm not entirely 100% if I understand, but I've made the 'gaps' between the columns bigger, implications is that the width of the all columns (eg, the video), is also smaller (to keep the alignment correct). It is worth noting that this is a well known and used standard. I'll only change this on desktop (or anything wider than 1200px), as mobile or small screen users won't change as it'll typically only be in one column or the columns will be so thin it's a little more awkward to read. Resize your window and you'll see what I mean, but also test this on a mobile.</li>
                <li>In the google drive you will see a new “Who we are video called “ international 2” this has a outro on as we feel the one we have right now finishes a bit to bluntly. Please could you replace</li>

                <li class="complete">DG - Action - Waiting for Anna to share the image, 16:9 aspect ratio would be ideal and match the rest. - Update: Asset received and added. Complete</li>
                <li>One thing to note here, is that ideally this would be the same on all pages (our vision, our community, our cor activities).
                    Typically, images side by side next to text, in a mobile view (single column) would appear above the text, but I've changed that so that the headings appear above the image.
                    Also, on the our vision page, there are two headings (our vision and our culture), I've set them to be different to provide a little change on the page, but they are the same
                    when in a single column view. All of these have been updated so that the text is first when seen on a mobile device.</li>
                <li>Same again with the paragraphs, slightly thinner.</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done, same as above</li>
                <li>Here is the text for the heading “ Our core activities bring important, relational definition to our vision and values. These include:”</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>

        <section>
            <h3>Home page</h3>
            <p>I've made the video full screen, but a common problem is that when switching to a mobile view, the text is clipped (I'm assuming you're wanting to use the MOVING_IMAGES.mp4 video).</p>
            <p>Typically, the text is not in the video background, but overlayed ontop as to keep the correct dimensions and feel in different device views.</p>
            <p>It also clashes somewhat with core messaging eg, 'Welcome to skylark'. I'd suggest (for this case), of using a video without any text</p>
            <p>So, I've added a dummy video, and a few options. If you want to continue with the real video as the text, if you could supply the video without text and an indication of layout (as per home-3), that would be great.</p>
            <p>Also, the navigation itself doesn't have the greatest contrast and the background colours aren't the best. An white version of the logo would help as you would normally put a darker backgorund overlay ontop of a video with lighter text ontop of that</p>
            <p>With logo, the general trend is that they or more horizontally focused on the web, otherwise it makes some of the text a little harder to read or makes the navigation bars too large</p>
            <p>See examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/home-1.html">home-1 - With supplied video (text sits on top), moved the items to fit around text, video text should be replaced with real text that rotates to match the video</a></li>
                <li><a href="/home-2.html">home-2 - With a demo video without background text, also with example white logo and text, vertically aligned banner</a></li>
                <li><a href="/home-3.html">home-3 - Same as 2, but black text and logo as per the style guide</a></li>

            </ul>
            <p>Please look at these on desktop and mobile, as it does make a pretty big difference</p>
            <p>Feel free to respond with a mixture of suggestions</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Who are we</h3>
            <p>Video is set to auto play, but most browsers require a click, just standard browser based controls. If you want to provide an image overlay with a 'click to play' button, then great</p>
            <p>3 down arrows - With background (like the vision doc pdf - Why Skylark International) or without (like the assets provided - Our Commitment)</p>
            <p>Feel free to suggest font size adjustments</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/who-are-we-1.html">who-are-we-1 - 3 down arrows no background</a></li>
                <li><a href="/who-are-we-2.html">who-are-we-2 - 3 down arrows with background</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Our vision</h3>
            <p>A few options here:</p>
            <p>The heading titles can be plain standard text like the vision document (in our-vision-1) or some kind of image banner (in our-vision-2)</p>
            <p>I couldn't quite get what the word document was intending around the culture items, but I've added two options, a flat list with images (in our-vision-1) or a rotating carousel (in our-vision-2). Note: The rotating carousel really needs the images without the text on them other it doesn't work on mobiles</p>
            <p>Pick and choose which aspects you would like</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/our-vision-1.html">our-vision-1 - Standard text banner, culture list</a></li>
                <li><a href="/our-vision-2.html">our-vision-2 - Generic image banner, culture carousel</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Our community</h3>
            <p>Same as our vision, in terms of the headings</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/our-community-1.html">our-community-1 - Standard headings</a></li>
                <li><a href="/our-community-2.html">our-community-2 - Generic image headings</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Our core activities</h3>
            <p>Same as our vision, in terms of the headings</p>
            <p>It would be good to a get a small blurb of text to accompany the header. Dummy text added below</p>
            <p>There is no prayer doc attached, and unless it's kept up to date, I don't suggest adding one, so I've removed the sentence, but feel free to suggest an alternative or provide the doc</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/our-core-activities-1.html">our-core-activities-1 - Standard headings</a></li>
                <li><a href="/our-core-activities-2.html">our-core-activities-2 - Generic image headings</a></li>
