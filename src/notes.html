            <h5>HOME PAGE</h5>
            <li>Anna has uploaded a final background video to replace the one as stands</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>Put a gap between Skylark and International, The sentence below that tweaked to say this instead "Welcome to Skylark International" then a new line
                "Rebuilding Ruins • Building Bridges • Creating Culture</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>Therefore could the footer only on the home page have the below left and right to make it look cleaner and less text?

                Charity Number: 1097111</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>

            <h5>WHO ARE WE</h5>

            <li>The Sims have asked for consistency for each page to look the same at the top if we can?
                At the very top of the page can we have
                WHO WE ARE? and then the | like you have on the other pages with this bold sentence
                "SKYLARK INTERNATIONAL is a relational network of Churches, Charities and Ministries"</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - I think I get what you mean. This does make the video quite small, but it can be made fullscreen. If you'd prefer to have a small holding image and then the main big video below, let me know and if Anna can provide an image, that would be great</li>
            <li>They would like to change the title from "WHO ARE WE" to "WHO WE ARE" instead please</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done, but you'll also need to ask Anna to replace the text in the who are we video. It'd also make sense to get rid of the whitespace in the video now that the logo is gone too, but your call</li>
            <li class="sky">Action - Anna to provide a video with 'who we are' in the title rather than 'who are we'</li>
            <li>Thanks to Anna a FINAL new video has been uploaded without the water colour logo on the right which is there preference as they didn't want a double logo</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>Why Skylark International to have a ? after it</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>In "Why Skylark" there is a sentence ..."However well a church or organisation is functioning, we believe there is always a greater" please delete the a</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>

            <h5>OUR VISION</h5>
            <li>Please delete "Skylark International is a relational network of churches, ministries and kingdom initiatives" The top sentence will start with "Our purpose..."</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>Thanks to Anna a FINAL new video has been uploaded without the wall image and a different one</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>Due to the above the bottom carousel image for RR now needs to be changed to the new image in the drop box</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>The bottom carousel in BB the first sentence "We are missional" please delete "Skylarks sour in heavenly places but nest on the ground" therefore the sentence starts with " we carry Gods"</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>On a mobile The bottom carousel in CC doesn't start at the top, could you have a look and see if you can do anything?</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done, I didn't really like this. It's a lot of text compared to the other two. I've made it slightly wider on a small devices view, only for this though</li>

            <h5>OUR COMMUNITY</h5>
            <li>Thanks to Anna a new image "our community" has been uploaded to replace the Umbrella one</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done, but it was in a slightly different aspect ratio and format so I've cropped it to be consistent with the others</li>

            <h5>OUR CORE ACTIVITIES</h5>
            <li>Under prayer please delete "Spearheaded by Sue Gibson, our Prayer Pastor, along with an amazing leadership team" therefore the sentence starts ...."We have established"</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>Under connect and converge please delete "These times are usually held in Chelmsford, although more recently they have moved online due to covid"</li>
            <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
            <li>In Family Connect please change "thise" to "those"</li>

            <h5>HOME PAGE</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>I have changed the background video. This has now been uploaded to the drive in 'Videos' it is called 'BACKGROUND VIDEO NEW (NO WORDS)'</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
                <li>The Header is great, when I said about spacing closer to the edge, I meant a uniform scale closer to the edge, just to make more space for the centre logo and words, perhaps we could achieve this with a slightly smaller centre logo and wording</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - I'm interpreting this as 'I would like the horizontal and vertical spacing on the corners of the page to be equal'.
                    Hopefully thats right. The only problem with this is that there is a little vertical alignment WITHIN the header and footers themselves and it does get a bit tricky with different browser / phone widths.
                    I've attempted to reduce the vertical distance between the navigation links (but not the logo) with the top of the page so that it's roughly the same gap as the side of the page.
                    The footer also aligns vertically itself inside, so if content spills onto a second line (almost guaranteed on small devices, it'll also be aligned).
                    For now, I've tidied it up a little - Big screen = all on one line, mid-size = spills over onto two lines if required, mobile = 3 separate lines for each item, all centred.
                    Alternatively, if you could take a screenshot and annotate what you want moving where (for different screen sizes), that might help clarify if I've misunderstood.
                </li>
                <li>I think the footer writing could all be smaller? The alignment of the charity number etc.. looks out of place next to the other 2 bits of writing, is there anything we can do about that? Could it be brought underneath the Skylark International copyright bit?</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done. 20px instead of 24px. This is a slight misalign between the font types, but I'd prefer not to correct that if it's ok in terms of time to fix</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>WHO ARE WE</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The Skylark International logo with the blue colour behind it looks fuzzy. I have uploaded a higher quality version to the drive</li>
                <li class="complete">DG - Just to confirm, this logo is in the video (hopefully we're talking about the same thing). If you could update the video with the unblurred logo, that would be great. Action - Waiting for Anna to update the video with clearer logo - Update: Asset received and added. Complete</li>
                <li>There is a slight alignment issue with the 'our commitment' paragraph</li>

                <li class="dg">DG - Done</li>
                <li>I have added new higher quality images for that page, so they can all be replaced</li>

                <li>Also the body of text, if we could make the paragraph thinner each side. It may mean we need to make the body text smaller but just so there is more gap between them, as I feel they are a tiny bit too close.</li>
                <li class="dg">DG - Done. I'm not entirely 100% if I understand, but I've made the 'gaps' between the columns bigger, implications is that the width of the all columns (eg, the video), is also smaller (to keep the alignment correct). It is worth noting that this is a well known and used standard. I'll only change this on desktop (or anything wider than 1200px), as mobile or small screen users won't change as it'll typically only be in one column or the columns will be so thin it's a little more awkward to read. Resize your window and you'll see what I mean, but also test this on a mobile.</li>

                    Typically, images side by side next to text, in a mobile view (single column) would appear above the text, but I've changed that so that the headings appear above the image.
                    Also, on the our vision page, there are two headings (our vision and our culture), I've set them to be different to provide a little change on the page, but they are the same
                    when in a single column view. All of these have been updated so that the text is first when seen on a mobile device.</li>

        <section>
            <h3>Home page</h3>
            <p>I've made the video full screen, but a common problem is that when switching to a mobile view, the text is clipped (I'm assuming you're wanting to use the MOVING_IMAGES.mp4 video).</p>
            <p>Typically, the text is not in the video background, but overlayed ontop as to keep the correct dimensions and feel in different device views.</p>
            <p>It also clashes somewhat with core messaging eg, 'Welcome to skylark'. I'd suggest (for this case), of using a video without any text</p>
            <p>So, I've added a dummy video, and a few options. If you want to continue with the real video as the text, if you could supply the video without text and an indication of layout (as per home-3), that would be great.</p>
            <p>Also, the navigation itself doesn't have the greatest contrast and the background colours aren't the best. An white version of the logo would help as you would normally put a darker backgorund overlay ontop of a video with lighter text ontop of that</p>
            <p>With logo, the general trend is that they or more horizontally focused on the web, otherwise it makes some of the text a little harder to read or makes the navigation bars too large</p>
            <p>See examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/home-1.html">home-1 - With supplied video (text sits on top), moved the items to fit around text, video text should be replaced with real text that rotates to match the video</a></li>
                <li><a href="/home-2.html">home-2 - With a demo video without background text, also with example white logo and text, vertically aligned banner</a></li>
                <li><a href="/home-3.html">home-3 - Same as 2, but black text and logo as per the style guide</a></li>

            </ul>
            <p>Please look at these on desktop and mobile, as it does make a pretty big difference</p>
            <p>Feel free to respond with a mixture of suggestions</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Who are we</h3>
            <p>Video is set to auto play, but most browsers require a click, just standard browser based controls. If you want to provide an image overlay with a 'click to play' button, then great</p>
            <p>3 down arrows - With background (like the vision doc pdf - Why Skylark International) or without (like the assets provided - Our Commitment)</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Our vision</h3>
            <p>A few options here:</p>
            <p>The heading titles can be plain standard text like the vision document (in our-vision-1) or some kind of image banner (in our-vision-2)</p>
            <p>I couldn't quite get what the word document was intending around the culture items, but I've added two options, a flat list with images (in our-vision-1) or a rotating carousel (in our-vision-2). Note: The rotating carousel really needs the images without the text on them other it doesn't work on mobiles</p>
            <p>Pick and choose which aspects you would like</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/our-vision-1.html">our-vision-1 - Standard text banner, culture list</a></li>
