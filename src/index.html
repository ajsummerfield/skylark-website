            <h3>Home page</h3>
            <p>I've made the video full screen, but a common problem is that when switching to a mobile view, the text is clipped (I'm assuming you're wanting to use the MOVING_IMAGES.mp4 video).</p>
            <p>Typically, the text is not in the video background, but overlayed ontop as to keep the correct dimensions and feel in different device views.</p>
            <p>It also clashes somewhat with core messaging eg, 'Welcome to skylark'. I'd suggest (for this case), of using a video without any text</p>
            <p>So, I've added a dummy video, and a few options. If you want to continue with the real video as the text, if you could supply the video without text and an indication of layout (as per home-3), that would be great.</p>
            <p>Also, the navigation itself doesn't have the greatest contrast and the background colours aren't the best. An white version of the logo would help as you would normally put a darker backgorund overlay ontop of a video with lighter text ontop of that</p>
            <p>With logo, the general trend is that they or more horizontally focused on the web, otherwise it makes some of the text a little harder to read or makes the navigation bars too large</p>
            <p>See examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/home-1.html">home-1 - With supplied video (text sits on top), moved the items to fit around text, video text should be replaced with real text that rotates to match the video</a></li>
                <li><a href="/home-2.html">home-2 - With a demo video without background text, also with example white logo and text, vertically aligned banner</a></li>
                <li><a href="/home-3.html">home-3 - Same as 2, but black text and logo as per the style guide</a></li>

            </ul>
            <p>Please look at these on desktop and mobile, as it does make a pretty big difference</p>
            <p>Feel free to respond with a mixture of suggestions</p>
        </section>

            <h3>Who are we</h3>
            <p>Video is set to auto play, but most browsers require a click, just standard browser based controls. If you want to provide an image overlay with a 'click to play' button, then great</p>
            <p>3 down arrows - With background (like the vision doc pdf - Why Skylark International) or without (like the assets provided - Our Commitment)</p>
            <p>Feel free to suggest font size adjustments</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/who-are-we-1.html">who-are-we-1 - 3 down arrows no background</a></li>
                <li><a href="/who-are-we-2.html">who-are-we-2 - 3 down arrows with background</a></li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3>Our vision</h3>
            <p>A few options here:</p>
            <p>The heading titles can be plain standard text like the vision document (in our-vision-1) or some kind of image banner (in our-vision-2)</p>
            <p>I couldn't quite get what the word document was intending around the culture items, but I've added two options, a flat list with images (in our-vision-1) or a rotating carousel (in our-vision-2). Note: The rotating carousel really needs the images without the text on them other it doesn't work on mobiles</p>
            <p>Pick and choose which aspects you would like</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/our-vision-1.html">our-vision-1 - Standard text banner, culture list</a></li>
                <li><a href="/our-vision-2.html">our-vision-2 - Generic image banner, culture carousel</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Our community</h3>
            <p>Same as our vision, in terms of the headings</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/our-community-1.html">our-community-1 - Standard headings</a></li>
                <li><a href="/our-community-2.html">our-community-2 - Generic image headings</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Our core activities</h3>
            <p>Same as our vision, in terms of the headings</p>
            <p>It would be good to a get a small blurb of text to accompany the header. Dummy text added below</p>
            <p>There is no prayer doc attached, and unless it's kept up to date, I don't suggest adding one, so I've removed the sentence, but feel free to suggest an alternative or provide the doc</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/our-core-activities-1.html">our-core-activities-1 - Standard headings</a></li>
                <li><a href="/our-core-activities-2.html">our-core-activities-2 - Generic image headings</a></li>
            </ul>
